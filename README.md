# E-commerce AI Assistant
An e-commerce AI assistant built with [Langchain.rb](https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb) and OpenAI. This demo articulates the idea that business logic will now also live in prompts. A lot of modern software development is stringing services (classes and APIs) together. This demo illustrate how AI can assist in executing business logic and orchestrating calls to various services.
